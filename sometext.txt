"There are all these dimensions, worlds, alternate realities, and they're all right on top of each other.
Every time you make a choice, a decision, it forks off into a new possibility.
We wanted truism, chances, the movements that would allow us to travel to dimensions permanently.
And stay there.
We wanted a new life, in a new world.
To us, that was freedom."
